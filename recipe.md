STEP 1
Shell the prawns, leaving the little end tail in place. Butterfly the prawns by gently running a sharp knife along the back of the prawns so that they open up and remove the black vein.

STEP 2
Heat the butter in a large frying pan. Lightly crush the cumin seeds with a pestle and mortar and add to the pan with the garlic. Fry for 1 minute before tossing in the prawns and cooking for 2-3 minutes until theyâ€™ve turned pink. Stir through the parsley and a good squeeze of lemon juice, and serve with crusty bread, if you like.
